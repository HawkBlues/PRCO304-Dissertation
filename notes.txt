--------------
Cannot use Cloud Vison API as it requires a static file location (Link)
Alternatives
•	Cannot use Mobile Vision, does not support Photo labelling (Which is what I need)
•	ML Kit for Firebase, requires the blaze plan ($1.50/k) (Should be free for my usage)

I mistakenly thought I could use the API directly, I have to use it via ML kit for Firebase…
